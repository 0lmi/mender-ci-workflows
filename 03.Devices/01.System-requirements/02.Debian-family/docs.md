Currently Mender supports installation into Debian-based systems, including Raspbian and Ubuntu.

See [Building a Mender Debian Image](../../../../artifacts/building-mender-image/building-debian-image) for more details.

The [Bootloader support section](bootloader-support) provides more information for installing a bootloader which supports Mender updates.
