##Overview

In order to support robust rollback, Mender requires the device to have a certain partition layout.
At least four different partitions are needed:
* one boot partition, containing the U-Boot bootloader and its environment
* two partitions for storing the root file system and kernel. The kernel image file, zImage, and any device tree binary should be stored in directory /boot
* one for persistent data

One of the rootfs and kernel partitions will be marked as the *active* partition, from which the kernel and rootfs will be booted.
The other, called the *inactive* partition, will be used by the update mechanism to write the updated image.
After an update their roles are swapped.

The persistent data partition stores data that needs to be preserved through an update.

A sample partition layout is shown below:
