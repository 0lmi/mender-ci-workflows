The [mender-convert](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-conversion-tools?target=_blank) tools provides for building and installing [patched U-Boot](https://github.com/mendersoftware/uboot-mender?target=blank) for Raspbian. Currently only a patched U-Boot is supported by Mender on Raspberry Pi 3.
