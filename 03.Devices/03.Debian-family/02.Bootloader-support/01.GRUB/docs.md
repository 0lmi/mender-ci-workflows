The [mender-convert](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-conversion-tools?target=_blank) tools use GRUB as second stage bootloader for Debian on Beaglebone. This tool build GRUB from the [official repository](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-download.html?target=_blank). Mender does not require any patches for GRUB and should be built with EFI platform support.
