##Your project is using a fork of U-Boot which conflicts with the U-Boot Mender uses

When [Building a Mender Yocto Project image](../../Artifacts/Building-Mender-Yocto-image) for your own project and device, you encounter a build error similar to the following:

```
ERROR: Multiple .bb files are due to be built which each provide u-boot (.../tisdk/sources/meta-variscite/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot-var-som-am33.bb .../tisdk/sources/meta-ti/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot_2014.07.bb).
 This usually means one provides something the other doesn't and should.
```

Mender needs to configure U-Boot in order to support robust rootfs rollback. If your project relies on a fork of U-Boot this needs to be integrated. For more information, see [Integrating with U-Boot](../../Devices/Integrating-with-U-Boot), in particular the section on [Forks of U-boot](../../Devices/Integrating-with-U-Boot#forks-of-u-boot).
